# Express TypeScript Boilerplate

This project is a basic starting template for building an API using Express with TypeScript. It includes the essential initial configurations to get started with efficient development, utilizing best practices such as strong typing and modular code organization. The project structure includes directories for controllers, middlewares, routes, services, and utilities, along with a TypeScript configuration file (`tsconfig.json`) and a script to run the server in development mode using `ts-node` and `nodemon`. The development environment can be easily configured using a `.env` file to store environment variables, and the project is already set up to run unit and integration tests with `jest` and `supertest`. The folder structure makes it easy to maintain and scale the project as it grows.
